I am happy to announce that I have been accepted into the Bangkit Academy program. The program is a collaboration between Google, Gojek, Tokopedia, and Traveloka. Bangkit Academy is a program that aims to equip students with in-demand skills and tech certifications. The program offers 3 interdisciplinary learning paths - machine learning, mobile development, and cloud computing. By the end of this program, I will be equipped with the tech expertise, soft skills, and English proficiency I need to transit from academia to the workplace and succeed at leading companies.

## Mobile development path

I have chosen the mobile development path for my learning journey. In this path, I will learn how to build mobile applications using Kotlin. As of now (27/02/2024), I have completed the fourth module of the course and have finally developed my first Android application; a simple calculator app. While it's a beginning, it marks a significant milestone for me.

## Kotlin

As a web developer that already familiar with TypeScript, I found Kotlin is a bit similar to TypeScript especially the type declaration and the syntax.

```kotlin
// Kotlin
val a: Int = 1
```

```typescript
// TypeScript
let a: number = 1;
```

Although there are differences 😅, I am enjoying learning Kotlin. I've discovered numerous built-in functions that aid me in various tasks. In just three weeks, I have grown fond of this language. I am hopeful that I will create numerous Android applications in the future. Additionally, I plan to explore Kotlin beyond mobile development.
